# zimbra force smtp auth

*[networking](../README.md#networking)*

by default my Zimbra 8.7 installation doesn't require authentication when connect to SMTP declaring from and to same domain and this can result in a security risk because spam sender came apparently from inside alerting your account hacked but that isn't in the real.
to avoid that follow intructions at this link
